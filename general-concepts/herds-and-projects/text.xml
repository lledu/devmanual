<title>Herdså’ŒProjects</title>

<body>

<p>
A <e>herd</e> is a collection of packages with an associated set of maintainers.
It can happen for example because of retirement that a herd has no developers
but this should be avoided if at all possible. A herd has an associated email
address which can be used for bugzilla assignments. This email address is
<b>not</b> always <c>herdname@gentoo.org</c> <d/> for example, because of the
way Gentoo's email aliases are set up, the <c>cron</c> herd use
<c>cron-bugs@gentoo.org</c> (aliases cannot match system usernames).
</p>

<p>
A <e>project</e> is a group formed for handling a particular general area. A project
may have herds associated with it.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes herd and project names overlap <d/> for example, the <c>sparc</c> project
has an associated <c>sparc</c> herd which maintains sparc-specific packages (such
as the <c>silo</c> bootloader). This is <e>not</e> always the case.
