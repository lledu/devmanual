<title>Sandbox(沙盒)</title>

<p>
During the <c>src_unpack</c>, <c>src_compile</c>, <c>src_test</c> and <c>src_install</c>
phases, <c>ebuild.sh</c> operates inside a <e>sandbox</e>. This is a special environment
which attempts to help prevent badly written ebuilds (or ebuilds working with
badly written build systems) accidentally writing outside of permitted locations.
</p>

<p>
<b>All packages must build correctly when sandbox is active.</b> Packages must not
achieve this by using sneaky tricks to make sandbox warnings not show up <d/> the
sandbox is there to ensure that binary packages will work correctly, and that
a badly written <c>Makefile</c> won't cause problems. Using <c>addwrite</c> is
generally <b>not</b> the correct solution.
</p>

See <uri link="::function-reference/sandbox-functions/"/> for details on
sandbox-related functions. See <uri
link="::appendices/common-problems/#Handling Access Violations"/> for suggestions
on fixing sandbox-related build problems.
